# Grounding Your Self


## Intro

These may sound silly and far too simple, but I promise, these
techniques did actually work for me.  One of the most important things
about this is that you need to give yourself time. Try not to expect
that doing these exercises once will "cure" you of dissociation,
because frankly it won't.


__THERE ARE NO SILVER BULLETS.__

It sounds like you experience a pretty profound and continuous state
of dissociation and that it's been going on for a long time.  Patterns
like that don't just change overnight. It will take time, patience and
persistence to make these kinds of changes. The more support you can
get from other people, whether it's friends or family, a support
group, or a therapist, having people to support you is going to be
critical. It seems pretty likely that if you are in a constant or
semi-constant state of dissociation there are probably a __LOT__ of
repressed emotions hiding underneath it, and one of the things that
you may notice as you begin to reintegrate is that those emotions will
start to come out, whether you want them to or not. So try to be
prepared. And also, take it slow.


## Coming Back

### What's the Difference

First you need to learn to identify when you are dissociated and what
it feels like to _not_ be dissociated.  Dissociation often manifests
as a feeling of floating above or outside one's body rather than
inhabiting it, or a feeling of floatiness, or even mild dizziness. I
also often notice that I cannot easily access the physical sensations
that are happening in my body while I'm dissociated.

Learning to recognize _when_ you are dissociated is probably going to
be more challenging without someone to interact with about it, because
the very nature of being in a dissociated state means you are unlikely
to notice it.  To counteract this, it's useful to try and develop a
habit of periodically throughout the day checking in with yourself and
asking "How am I feeling right now? Do I feel dissociated?" Then check
for the specific physical sensations (or lack thereof) that you will
begin to associate with being dissociated.

If you have a good friend whose help you feel comfortable enlisting in
this project, maybe have them read this, and tell them to watch for
sudden changes in your behavior and when they do see that to gently
inform you. This can then be a cue for you to check in with yourself
about your current state of integration, and maybe do some exercises
to ground yourself.

Personally, I've found that most of my friends were aware of _when_ I
was going into dissociative states, just not what they were. For me
particularly, I tend to dissociate in emotionally charged situations,
particularly intense conversations. And when I do dissociate in these
situations I go from being tactfully truthfully, to brutally honest in
a way that can be quite hurtful.  And I'm capable of being hurtful in
this way precisely because I have dissociated from my own feelings.


### Body Scan

The flip side of recognizing dissociation is to be able to recognize
what it feels like to be fully integrated. One of the best techniques
that I know for this is to do a body-scan meditation.  A body-scan
meditation is essentially just simply paying attention to the
sensations you are feeling in every part of your body, one at a time.

Focusing your attention on just the physical sensations in a specific
part of your body, and then "scanning" that level of attention across
your entire body.

I highly recommend the 'body scan' and 'body scan for preparing for
sleep' guided meditation on the [UCLA Mindful Awareness Research
Center's site](https://www.uclahealth.org/marc/mindful-meditations).


### Summary

Basically, learning to recognize when you are dissociated or
integrated is about learning more about yourself and how _you_
function. Try not to be judgmental or cruel to yourself while
exploring how you function.  Instead, try to cultivate simple
curiosity, and a process of discovery.


## Maintenance

Once you start to notice the dissociation happening in real time, you
can start using these maintenance techniques to bring yourself back
right away.  Think of these techniques as First Aid for
dissociation. Apply them immediately on noticing any dissociation
symptoms. Or even pre-emptively! These exercises can also be good for
simply calming anxiety or taking the edge off of any kind of upset.


### Side-to-side Scan

Turn your head as far as it is comfortable for you to the left, and
then slowly (at about 5 degree per second turn) slowly focus your eyes
on specific objects you can see in your visual field.  I also find it
helpful to mentally name each object I focus on.  Make sure to
continue breathing while doing this scan. Continue this scan until
your head has turned as far as it is comfortable for you to turn to
the right. Keep doing this until you feel more grounded, less
dissociated, calmer, less anxious or whatever caused you do the scan
in the first place.


### EMDR

EMDR at it's core is really just moving your eyes from side to side. I
know this sounds absurd, but please just try it. It can be helpful to
have concrete points to focus on while doing this, so just pick two
objects in your field of vision that you can focus your eyes on
without moving your head. Then, look at the one on the left for the
space of a breath, then look at the one on the right for the space of
a breath, repeat ad nauseam or until you feel better.


### Walking/Exercise

It's trite advice at this point, but getting regular exercise is a
great way to stay connected to your body. It's also good for your
mental state.  I go on a walk every day to get me a) out of the house
at least once, and b) at least a little bit of exercise.

Walking can also be combined with the side-to-side scan or EMDR eye
movements.  In fact, I find EMDR to be most helpful when I'm walking.


### Getting a Different Perspective

Talk to people about the things that are bothering you. If you only
think about it in your own head it's easy to get stuck in loops, and
those loops often have an emotional effect on us.  Simply talking to
someone else can be helpful in breaking painful thought loops, which
are my number one trigger for going into dissociative states.


### Socializing

Social contact is great, and with the internet it's easier to find
something to do with people than ever before. Even if you don't know
anyone, or you feel nervous or anxious about socializing, do it
anyway.  Running away from those fears or anxieties only makes them
worse.


### Meditation

Meditation can be extremely helpful.  There are many, many meditation
apps on various phone platforms, and there are free resources
available online. If you don't have experience with meditation, guided
meditations are a good place to start.  Here are a few resources I've
used and liked:

- [UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center](https://www.uclahealth.org/marc/mindful-meditations)
- [The Waking Up app](https://wakingup.com/)
- [10% Happier](https://www.tenpercent.com/)

Also, there are many YouTube channels that have guided meditations and
"auto-hypnosis" videos, but the quality tends to vary _widely_. Look
around, and find ones that you like and that work for you.

The UCLA meditations are simple and basic, but helpful. I used those
for a long time before moving on to other things. The Waking Up app
and 10% Happier are both good apps for providing a progression of
meditation lessons to actually teach you how to meditate and more of
the full range of what you can use it for and the many different ways
there are to practice it.

Also, most of the content in the Waking Up
app is behind a pay-wall, but if you truly cannot afford it you can
get free access to the subscription for a year by writing an email to
the developers of the app (info about how that works is
[here](https://help.wakingup.com/article/54-how-much-does-the-waking-up-course-cost)
).

You do have to practice it though.  Even practicing meditation for
just ten minutes a day can be extremely impactful, so don't think it
has to be a gigantic commitment of time.
