# Grounding Your Self


## Intro

These may sound silly and far to simple, but I promise, they did
actually work for me.  One of the most important things about this is
that you need to give yourself time. Try not to expect that doing
these exercises once will "cure" you of dissociation.  It sounds like
you experience a pretty profound and continuous state of dissociation
and that it's been going on for a long time.  Patterns like that don't
just change overnight.  Instead, try to think of these exercises as
first-aid that you can apply to try and reconnect with your body and
emotions.

### What's the Difference


### Body Scan

For dissociation in particular I have found body-scan guided
meditations to be very helpful. A body-scan  meditation is essentially
trying to enter a meditative state and then focusing your attention on
just the physical sensations in a specific part of your body, and then
"scanning" that level of attention across your entire body.

I highly recommend the 'body scan' and 'body scan for preparing for sleep'
guided meditation on the UCLA site.

Next, you need to learn to recognize the difference between being
dissociated and not.  My main cues are feeling a bit "floaty" or like
my visual perspective is a bit zoomed out. I also


## Maintenance


### Side-to-side Scan

Turn your head as far as it is comfortable for you to the left, and
then slowly (at about 5 degree per second turn) slowly focus your eyes
on specific objects you can see in your visual field.  I also find it
helpful to mentally name each object I focus on.  Make sure to
continue breathing while doing this scan. Continue this scan until
your head has turned as far as it is comfortable for you to turn to
the right. Keep doing this until you feel more grounded, less
dissociated, calmer, less anxious or whatever caused you do the scan
in the first place.


### Getting a Different Perspective


### Socializing


### Walking/Exercise


### Meditation

First off, meditation can be extremely helpful.  There are many, many
meditation apps on various phone platforms, and there are free
resources available online. If you don't have experience with
meditation, guided meditations are a good place to start.  Here are a
few resources I've used:

- [UCLA free mindfulness guided meditations](https://www.uclahealth.org/marc/mindful-meditations)
- [The Waking Up app](https://wakingup.com/)
- [10% Happier](https://www.tenpercent.com/)

Also, there are many YouTube channels that have guided meditations and
"auto-hypnosis" videos, but the quality tends to vary _widely_.

The UCLA meditations are simple and basic, but helpful. I used those
for a long time before moving on to other things. The Waking Up app
and 10% Happier are both good apps for providing a progression of
meditation lessons to actually teach you how to meditate and more of
the full range of what you can use it for and the many different ways
there are to practice it.  Also, most of the content in the Waking Up
app is behind a pay-wall, but if you truly cannot afford it you can
get free access to the subscription for a year by writing an email to
the developers of the app (info about how that works is
[here](https://help.wakingup.com/article/54-how-much-does-the-waking-up-course-cost)
).

You do have to practice it though.  Even practicing meditation for
just ten minutes a day can be extremely impactful, so don't think it
has to be a gigantic commitment of time.
