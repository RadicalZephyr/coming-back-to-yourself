# Grounding Your Self

## Intro

Someone posted recently wondering about Alexithymia. I'm not any kind
of mental health professional, but I have been doing therapy a lot for
the last few years. In particular, I have struggled with a tendency to
dissociate from myself, which for me ends up feeling a lot like the
description of Alexithymia.  My suggestion to that poster was to find
a therapist to work on this with. But not everyone has the resources
to do that, so I decided to write this short article on what I've
learned about how to recognize when you are in a state of dissociation
and how to reintegrate your mind and body in order to leave that
state.

Some of these exercises may sound silly or "too simple," but I
promise, they did - and still do - actually work for me.  One of the
most important things to keep in mind about this process is that you
need to give yourself time. Try not to expect that doing these
exercises once will "cure" you of dissociation, because frankly it
won't.


__THERE ARE NO SILVER BULLETS.__


From my own experience, I think dissociation tends to become a long
term state of being.  If you have been in a profound and continuous
state of dissociation for a long time then this pattern is not going
to just change overnight. It will take time, patience and persistence
to make these kinds of changes. The more support you can get from
other people, whether it's friends or family, a support group, or a
therapist, having people to support you is going to be critical. It
seems pretty likely that if you are in a constant or semi-constant
state of dissociation there are probably a __LOT__ of repressed
emotions hiding underneath it, and one of the things that you may
notice as you begin to reintegrate is that those emotions will start
to come out, whether you want them to or not. So try to be
prepared. And also, take it slow.


## Coming Back

### What's the Difference

In order to change your patterns you first need to identify when
they're happening. So before you can first you need to learn to
identify when you are dissociated and what it feels like to _not_ be
dissociated.  Dissociation can manifest as a feeling of floating above
or outside one's body rather than inhabiting it, or a feeling of
floatiness, or even mild dizziness. However, everyone is a bit
different, and you may have a different experience of learning to
recognize _your_ dissociation. Personally, I most readily notice my
dissociation by checking on the physical sensations in my body, and
noticing the _lack_ of sensations that I know I should be feeling,
like sitting on a chair for instance.

Learning to recognize _when_ you are dissociated is key. But the very
nature of being in a dissociated state means you are unlikely to
notice it.  To counteract this, it's useful to try and develop a habit
of checking in with yourself periodically throughout the day and
asking "How am I feeling right now? Do I feel dissociated?" Then check
for the specific physical sensations (or lack thereof) that you will
begin to associate with being dissociated.

If you have a good friend whose help you feel comfortable enlisting in
this project, maybe have them read this, and tell them to watch for
sudden changes in your behavior and when they do see that to gently
inform you. This can then be a cue for you to check in with yourself
about your current state of integration, and maybe do some exercises
to ground yourself.

Personally, I've found that most of my friends were aware of _when_ I
was going into dissociative states, but did not understand just not
what they were. For me particularly, I tend to dissociate in
emotionally charged situations, particularly intense conversations.
And when I do dissociate in these situations I go from being tactfully
truthful to brutally honest in a way that can be quite hurtful.  And
I'm capable of being hurtful in this way precisely because I have
dissociated from my own feelings.


### Body Scan

The flip side of recognizing dissociation is to be able to recognize
what it feels like to be fully integrated. One of the best techniques
that I know for this is to do a body-scan meditation.  A body-scan
meditation is essentially just paying attention to the sensations you
are feeling in every part of your body, one at a time.

Focusing your attention on just the physical sensations in a specific
part of your body, and then "scanning" that level of attention across
your entire body.

I highly recommend the 'body scan' and 'body scan for preparing for
sleep' guided meditation on the [UCLA Mindful Awareness Research
Center's site](https://www.uclahealth.org/marc/mindful-meditations).


### Summary

Basically, learning to recognize when you are dissociated or
integrated is about learning more about yourself and how _you_
function. Try not to be judgmental or cruel to yourself. Instead, try
to cultivate simple curiosity, and a process of discovery while you
explore how you specifically work.


## Maintenance

Once you start to notice the dissociation happening in real time, you
can start using these maintenance techniques to bring yourself back
right away.  Think of these techniques as First Aid for
dissociation. Apply them immediately on noticing any dissociation
symptoms. Or even pre-emptively! These exercises can also be good for
simply calming anxiety or taking the edge off of any kind of upset.


### Side-to-side Scan

Turn your head to the left as far as is comfortable, and then slowly
focus your eyes on specific objects you can see in your visual field
and internally name each object you focus on before moving to the
next. The important thing here is not to move your eyes and head too
quickly. You don't want to bounce from one object to the next without
really seeing them.  However, you also don't want to get "stuck" on
one object or get lost in thought in the middle of the head turn.

Make sure to continue breathing while doing this scan.  The first time
I did this exercise I was focusing so hard on the visual task that I
actually held my breath the whole time!

Continue this scan to the left until you reach the end of your range
of motion, and then reverse direction. Doing the same object by object
scan, now rotate your head all the way to the right as far as is
comfortable. Keep going back and forth until you feel more grounded,
less dissociated, calmer, or less anxious. The goal is to ease
whatever discomfort caused you to do the scan in the first place.


### Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)

At its core EMDR is really just moving your eyes from side to
side. I know this sounds absurd, but please just try it. It can be
helpful to have concrete points to focus on while doing this, so just
pick two objects in your field of vision that you can focus your eyes
on without moving your head. Then, look at the one on the left for the
space of a breath, then look at the one on the right for the space of
a breath. Repeat _ad nauseum_ or until you feel better.


### Walking/Exercise

It's trite advice at this point, but getting regular exercise is a
great way to stay connected to your body. It's also good for your
mental state.  I go on a walk every day to get me a) out of the house
at least once, and b) at least a little bit of exercise.

Walking can also be combined with the Side-to-Side scan or EMDR eye
movements.  In fact, I find that doing these exercises is even more
effective when I practice them while I'm walking.


### Getting a Different Perspective

Talk to people about the things that are bothering you. If you only
think about it in your own head it's easy to get stuck in loops, and
those loops often have an emotional effect on us.  Simply talking to
someone else can be helpful in breaking painful thought loops, which
are my number one trigger for going into dissociative states.


### Socializing

Social contact is great, and with the internet it's easier to find
something to do with people than ever before. Even if you don't know
anyone, or you feel nervous or anxious about socializing, do it
anyway.  Running away from those fears or anxieties only makes them
worse.


### Meditation

Meditation can be extremely helpful.  There are many, many meditation
apps on various phone platforms, and there are free resources
available online. If you don't have experience with meditation, guided
meditations are a good place to start.  Here are a few resources I've
used and liked:

- [UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center](https://www.uclahealth.org/marc/mindful-meditations)
- [The Waking Up app](https://wakingup.com/)
- [10% Happier](https://www.tenpercent.com/)

Also, there are many YouTube channels that have guided meditations and
"auto-hypnosis" videos, but the quality tends to vary _widely_. Look
around, and find ones that you like and that work for you.

The UCLA meditations are simple and basic, but helpful. I used those
for a long time before moving on to other things. The Waking Up app
and 10% Happier are both good apps for providing a progression of
meditation lessons to actually teach you how to meditate and more of
the full range of what you can use it for and the many different ways
there are to practice it.

Also, most of the content in the Waking Up
app is behind a pay-wall, but if you truly cannot afford it you can
get free access to the subscription for a year by writing an email to
the developers of the app (info about how that works is
[here](https://help.wakingup.com/article/54-how-much-does-the-waking-up-course-cost)
).

You do have to practice it though.  Even practicing meditation for
just ten minutes a day can be extremely impactful, so don't think it
has to be a gigantic commitment of time.
